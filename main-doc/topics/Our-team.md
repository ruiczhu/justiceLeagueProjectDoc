## Our tasks

## Task 1
- Implement the use of SAM2 locally to perform object segmentation on input images or videos.

## Task 2
- Implement OpenCV processing of the segmented image masks output by SAM, including:
  - Various levels of color change
  - Brightness adjustment
  - Removal
  - Mosaic
  - Gradient
  - Overlay
  - Replacing with emojis
  - Drawing rays around objects
  - Drawing circles to highlight objects

- Implement OpenCV processing of the background excluding the mask, including:
  - Various levels of color change
  - Brightness adjustment
  - Removal
  - Mosaic
  - Gradient
  - Desaturation
  - Adding text
  - Blurring

## Task 3
- Implement a simple user interface, including:
  - Uploading videos or images
  - User interaction for selecting content to be segmented
  - Choosing which processing effects to apply

## Task 4
- System testing, including:
  - Understanding the basic concepts of unit testing
  - Integration testing
  - System testing

## Task 5
- System and result analysis, including:
  - Establishing metrics to evaluate the system's performance, such as accuracy and processing speed
  - Recording the importance of each evaluation metric
  - Evaluating the system based on the established metrics
  - Analyzing the results
  - Deliverable: Evaluation report with data visualizations and detailed analysis

## Task 6
- Members selected for Task 1, 4, and 5 need to complete this part together:
  - Understand the background and development of the SAM2 model
  - Review relevant papers and literature, especially on image segmentation and computer vision research
  - Focus on the innovations of the SAM model and comparisons with other models
  - Compare the performance of the SAM model with other models on specific tasks
  - Analyze the specific application scenarios suitable for the SAM model
  - Study application cases of the SAM model in real projects
